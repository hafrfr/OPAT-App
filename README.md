# OPAT @ Home

**OPAT @ Home** is a digital health prototype designed to support patients receiving intravenous antibiotics at home through **Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT)**.

The projectâ€™s goal is to increase patient confidence, independence, and safety when receiving intravenous treatment at home, while supporting the healthcare systemâ€™s shift toward more scalable, home-based care.

This prototype was developed as part of the [Digital Health Implementation](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/course-selection-and-registration/select-courses/choose-a-tracks-course/digital-health-implementation/) course at **Chalmers University of Technology**, with guidance from faculty at **Stanford University** and clinical input from healthcare professionals in Sweden and the UK. The app is built using Stanfordâ€™s [Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi) framework.

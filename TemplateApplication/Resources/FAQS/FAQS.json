  },
  {
    "question": "What is the push-pause method?",
    "answer": "The push-pause method is a way to flush your PICC line that helps prevent blockages. Instead of pushing all the saline in at once, you gently push about 2 ml at a time, then pause briefly before pushing again — like a small pump motion. This creates turbulence in the line that helps clear the inside walls.\n\nYou’ll use this method whenever you flush your line — for example, before connecting your infusion and after disconnecting it.",
    "tags": ["Line Care & Hygiene"]
  },
  {
    "question": "Who is responsible for helping me during my OPAT treatment?",
    "answer": "Your OPAT care usually involves a mix of people, like your infection clinic, home healthcare nurses, and sometimes your pharmacy. Not all regions have a dedicated OPAT team, so your setup may be more flexible. No matter the structure, you are an important part of the care team — your role, routines, and awareness are key to making treatment at home work well. If you’re ever unsure, contact your nurse via the Contact tab.",
